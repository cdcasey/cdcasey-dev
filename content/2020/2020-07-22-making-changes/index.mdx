### Styling

Well, the first difference in the tutorial versus the way I wanted to do things was using Emotion instead of Styled Components. Fortunately, the Gatsby website has a nice writeup here: https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/emotion/. Also, if you're using VS Code, the [Styled Components plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jpoissonnier.vscode-styled-components) still works great with Emotion.

The only real difference in the way I did things vs the tutorial was the Emotion import. So instead of

```
import styled from 'styled-components';
```

I used

```
import styled from '@emotion/styled';
```

Everything else was the same!

The next section is on actually incorporating the posts into the site. However, I think I may want to start incorporating TypeScript now so that I don't have to go through the pain of adding it to the entire site.
